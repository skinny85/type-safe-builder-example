This module re-implements all 3 previous Builder examples found in the other submodules,
but using the [Jilt library](https://github.com/skinny85/jilt)
instead of writing all the code by hand.

Each `com.endoflineblog.type_safe_builder.submodule-0x` Java package corresponds
to the same numbered top-level submodule.
You also have tests in the [src/test/java](src/test/java) directory,
which demonstrate the usage of each Builder -
they are exactly the same as the corresponding usages from each of the submodules.
